To get started, you need to:

Set up your littleBits CloudBit with a button between the power source and CloudBit, like so:

Then, [remix this project](https://gomix.com/#!/remix/littlebits-api/9f67720d-ad82-43b1-a7a5-2edc81e35b48) and specify your Gomix publish URL and littleBits Access Token in the `.env` file.

The Gomix publish URL is the URL shown in the address bar of your browser when you click 'Show' in your remixed project. It has the format 'https://project-name.gomix.me', so in this example app the URL we used was 'https://littlebits-api.gomix.me'. Be sure not to include the trailing slash '/'.

You can get the littleBits Access Token from 'Settings' for your CloudBits device from [littleBits Cloud Control](http://control.littlebitscloud.cc).

That's it - you should now be able to click 'Show' and see your CloudBit device listed in the drop-down menu. Select it, and then press the button on your CloudBit. The page will update and display 'Device ON!'. It'll revert to 'Device off' when you let go of the button.

Now you're all set to edit the app and create your own web apps to interact with your littleBits CloudBit device.
